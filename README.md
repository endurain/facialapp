This is my facial recognition app that works with Clarifai's API FACIAL_DETECT_MODEL. It uses create-react-app. The app returns a box around the face of any user submitted image URL. The beauty in this app was
designing the box from percentage points returned from Clarifai API. It has a backend that stores
user login information and works off a custom DB built by yours truly.
